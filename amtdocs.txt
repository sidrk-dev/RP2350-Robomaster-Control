1. Insert Tool A as a spacer that defines the distance to
the mounting surface.
2. Slide appropriate sized Sleeve over shaft all the way down to Tool A.
3. Slide Shaft Adaptor over Sleeve.
4. Use Tool C to press Shaft Adaptor over Sleeve (ensure Shaft Adapter
and Tool C spline alignment) until flush with Tool A.
1. Remove Tools A and C.
2. Place Base on motor, with Tool C used as a centering tool.
1. Fasten the Base on the motor (Tool C may need to be
rotated to allow for some mounting configurations).
2. Remove Tool C.
1. Make sure the snaps are fully engaged by pressing
on the Hub with the reverse side of Tool C.
2. When assembly is finished, the Shaft Adaptor, Sleeve
and Rotor Hub should all be flush with the Motor
Shaft rotating freely.
1. Snap the Top Cover onto the Base, carefully observing that the
teeth of the Shaft Adaptor align with the grooves in the hub. *
* We recommend no more than three cycles of mounting and
removal of the AMT top cover base. Multiple cycles of mounting
and removing the top cover can cause base fatigue over time and
affect encoder performance.
1. Align Tool C with flange on Base.
2. Slide Base and Tool C onto motor, centering onto
the Shaft Adapter.

APPLICATION NOTES
• Initialization mode: At power up the encoder goes through an initiation and stabilization procedure. This includes microprocessor stabilization and the
program for getting the absolute start position. This takes less than 100 milliseconds.
• Tracking mode:
1. MCU 12 bit position register is updated from every 48 μs.
2. For accurate position information without the 48 μs incremental outputs A/B can be used for tracking. These outputs are
operational up to 8000 RPM without speed error.
3. When using the incremental output there also is a Z index pulse that occurs once per turn.
ENCODER OPERATIONAL MODE
The Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) bus is a standard serial interface that operates in full duplex mode. It consists of 4 signals:
1. MOSI: Master Out Slave In
2. MISO: Master In Slave Out
3. SCK: Serial Clock
4. CSB: Chip Select (active low)
SERIAL PERIPHERAL INTERFACE COMMANDS
SCK
MISO
MOSI
CSB
MSB LSB
MSB LSB
Setup
The SPI bus transfers multiples of 8 bits in a frame. Data is captured on the rising edge of SCK and the output data is changed after the falling edge of
SCK.
 Serial Peripheral Interface Bus (SPI) on AMT203 Timing Diagram
 (Figure 1)
The data out on MISO is valid once CSB goes low. The MOSI data is valid after the falling edge of SCK. The encoder drives data out on MISO for as long as
CSB is low.
Normally, CSB goes low, then after 8 clock cycles the command is interpreted. CSB high resets the clock counter, and terminates any command
sequence.
SPI BUS
Terminology
MSB = most significant byte
LSB = least significant byte
msb = most significant bit
lsb = least significant bit

APPLICATION NOTES (CONTINUED)
All commands are 8 bits long. The msb is shifted in first, and is the leftmost bit shown in Figure 1.
Encoder Protocol Considerations:
The encoder is designed to operate with a high speed SPI link, in full duplex mode. This implies the host can issue commands and read data as quickly
as necessary but there has to be an acknowledgement from the slave just before the data is transferred.
First the host will issue a command, then the encoder may respond with wait responses (0xA5) until ready. Once ready the encoder will echo the original
command received from the master, followed by the requested data.
For example, to read the position the master will send the rd_pos command (0x10), it will then send no operation commands (nop_a5, 0x00) until it
receives the original rd_pos command back. Once it receives the rd_pos response from the encoder, it knows that the next two bytes of data will be the
MSB and the LSB respectively. To receive those two bytes the master will send two no operation commands.
It is recommended that the master leave a 20 μs delay between reads to avoid extending the read time by forcing wait sequences.
Each byte transmitted must be followed by a release of the Chip Select line (CSB).
Command 0x00: nop_a5 (no operation)
This no operation command is ignored by the encoder and simply causes the next byte of data to be read. The encoder will respond with 0xA5 if there is
no remaining data to be sent.
Command 0x10: rd_pos (read position)
This command causes a read of the current position.
To read position this sequence should be followed:
1. Master sends rd_pos command. Encoder responds with idle character.
2. Continue sending nop_a5 command while encoder response is 0xA5
3. If response was 0x10 (rd_pos), send nop_a5 and receive MSB position (lower 4 bits of this byte are the upper 4 of the 12-bit
 position)
4. Send second nop_a5 command and receive LSB position (lower 8 bits of 12-bit positon)
Note that it is possible to overlap commands. For instance, instead of issuing nop_a5 for steps 3 and 4, you could begin another read position sequence
since the position data is already in the buffer. The read and write FIFOs for the streams are 16 bytes long and it is up to the user to avoid overflow.
Command 0x70: set_zero_point (zero set)
This command sets the current position to zero and saves this setting in the EEPROM.
To set the zero point this sequence should be followed:
1. Send set_zero_point command
2. Send nop_a5 command while response is not 0x80
3. A response of 0x80 means that the zero set was successful and the new position offset is stored in EEPROM.
4. The encoder must be power cycled. If the encoder is not power cycled, the position values will not be calculated off the latest zero position.
 When the encoder is powered on next the new offset will be used for the position calculation.
